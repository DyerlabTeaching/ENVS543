# ENVS 543: Environmental Data Literacy

<img align="right" src="dyer.png"> Hello.  My name is Dr. Rodney Dyer and this is a course I've developed to serve as the entry course for incoming Environmental Studies graduate students and advanced undergraduates.  

The rationale for this class is as follows.  

As both a student and instructor in statistics classes, I found I spent a vast amount of time and effort describing the characteristics of statistics (derivations, expectations, etc.).  This is perfectly fine, it is important on many levels to make sure that practitioners understand the basis and context of all the kinds of analyses they use.  However, the drawback here, in my experience, is that once you've spent a semester or year getting all this knowledge under your belt, and one can easily demonstrate their understanding of the parameters in a model, they cannot actually work with real data.  This class is designed to produce practitioners of data analysis.

To understand data analytics, one needs to recognize the entire workflow.  To the right is a brief graphical depiction of how analysis actually worksâ€”in the real world.  In this class, we will work on all of these components using the open-source R language.
